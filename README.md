## Inspiration
Online education has become a hassle because students have been flooded with lecture videos with little time to go over and see every video for their preferred topic of study. Therefore we need a solution that can help students become more productive.

## What it does
Modzed is an AI-powered application that
- Provides transcript of the uploaded video.
- Reduces a long video into a short, manageable summary.
- Helps users lookup for the desired topic/keyword in a video along with its timestamp.
- Give important topics covered in the video.
- Saves time of people who have to study large video-based content.

## How we built it
### Modzy AI models used are
- Video Captioning
- Text Summarization
- Text Topic Modeling
- Audio Keyword Spotting

### Other Tech Stack
- Python
- Dash
- Heroku
